```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Issues


### Broom

* prob with confint.mlm: opened issue
* prob with tidy.mlm, quick = TRUE: will send issue, just need instead:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
data.frame(response = rep(colnames(co), each = nrow(co)),
           term = rownames(co), 
           estimate = as.numeric(co), stringsAsFactors = FALSE) 

```

* prob with `lfe tidyr`: got in my broom/dev has fix. Wait for previous check

### lfe felm

* prob with extracting formula

## To do

* compute as few `quick=FALSE` as possible. Wait for issue of tidy.lm to be fixed!
